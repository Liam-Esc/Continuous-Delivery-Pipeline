AWS Continuous Delivery Pipeline

This project demonstrates how to build a complete CI/CD pipeline for a AWS web application using GitHub, AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and Elastic Beanstalk. The pipeline is triggered by changes to the GitHub repository, automatically building and deploying the latest code.

What This Project Does
- Stores app code in GitHub
- Builds the app automatically with AWS CodeBuild
- Deploys the app to an Elastic Beanstalk environment
- Continuously delivers new code when changes are pushed to the repo

- What was used
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk – Web application hosting
- AWS CodePipeline – CI CD3
- AWS CodeBuild – Automated build process
- GitHub – Source control
- Node.js / Python / Web app

- What I learned
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- CI/CD pipeline creation
- Cloud-native application deployment
- GitHub + AWS integration
